Random errands, exploring how to compress signal using the Discrete Cosine
Transform.

The notebook is [here (`dct.ipynb`)](https://github.com/Alexis-D/dct/blob/master/dct.ipynb), Github should render it almost properly (it's missing the sound playback). If you want to run the notebook yourself, in a virtualenv you can do:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter-notebook
```
